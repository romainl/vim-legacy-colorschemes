# vim-legacy-colorschemes

This repository contains the original colorschemes distributed with Vim, in the state they were when we started [work on the remakes](https://github.com/vim/colorschemes), packaged in a convenient, plugin-like way.

If you don't like the remake of your favourite colorscheme, you can install this plugin just like you would install any other plugin.

If in doubt, the canonical method for installing plugins is described under `:help packages`.
